# HoneyCast

A honeypot to collect media mistakenly or purposely streamed to Chromecast devices on the internet.

## Why

During the "casthack", a couple of cast-enabled devices on the public internet were attacked to stream videos of a famous YouTube personality. [[1]](http://casthack.thehackergiraffe.com)

This project aims to work with [pychromecast](https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast), a Python implementation of the Chromecast client API. So anyone scanning the internet and connecting to this honeypot shall think this is an actual device and do their shenanigans there.

## Usage

```bash
# todo
